<h1>Assumptions: Multiple Regression</h1>
<ol>
<li>Independence: The residuals are statistically independent.</li>
<li>Normality: The residuals follows a Normal distribution.</li>
<li>Homoscedasticity (Homogeneity of Variance): The variance of the residuals has a constant variance (at each level of the predictors).</li>
<li>Unbiasedness (linearity): The mean of the residuals is 0 (at each level of the predictors).</li>
</ol>
