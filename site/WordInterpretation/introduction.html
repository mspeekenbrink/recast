<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Evidence from several sources show that learning mechanisms make critical contributions to our ability to understand ambiguous words. First, numerous studies have shown a strong processing benefit for the meaning of a word that is most frequent in the language as a whole (e.g. Duffy, Morris, &amp; Rayner, 1988), such that the word &ldquo;pen&rdquo; is easier to understand in a phrase that uses its dominant meaning (e.g., &ldquo;the blue pen&rdquo;), compared when a low frequency meaning is used (e.g., &ldquo;the pig pen&rdquo;). Such findings suggest, indirectly, that individual encounters with a particular word meaning across our life-time can boost its availability, and also provide a clear demonstration of the impact of these preferences on our ability to rapidly understand these words in context â€“ by taking account of the likelihood of a particular word meaning occurring to enhance processing of the more likely meaning, we can (on average) reduce the time that it takes to process these words. In addition, we have recently provided the first direct evidence that listeners&rsquo; meaning preferences can be strongly increased by their recent experience, such that the low-frequency meaning of &ldquo;pen&rdquo; would become more readily available 20 minutes after hearing the sentence &ldquo;the farmer put the sheep in the pen&rdquo; (Rodd, Lopez Cutrin, Kirsch, Millar, &amp; Davis, 2012).</p>

<p>Despite longstanding indirect and recent direct evidence for this plasticity in lexical processing of ambiguous words, it is currently unknown how these different sources of information (short- and long-term experience) are integrated together to produce overall preferences for different meanings. People who are part of a very specific community or interest group often have atypical linguistic experience with particular word meanings, such that they encounter word meanings in a way that differs substantially from the wider population. As mentioned, it should be examined which aspects of their atypical experience are driving their preferences for particular word meanings. While the relative frequencies of such specific meanings will be close to zero for regular people, members of the particular community will encounter these meanings much more often and might even have adopted these interpretations as their preferred ones.</p>

<p>Regarding the theory from the previous section a research gap was identified concerning the origin of different interpretations of words by members of a specific community or group. Footballers, for example, might think of the word &ldquo;goal&rdquo; firstly as a place to kick a ball into, whereas other people may interpret this word as the aim of something. It seems likely that diverging interpretations of words will be due to the level of contact with members of the group and the amount of time spent taking part in the specific activity of the group (e.g. playing football with your team). The aim of the present study was to identify such factors that drive a biased understanding of words. As indicated in the previous section, putative variables to determine the interpretation of words are age, experience with, frequency of and recency of contextual exposure.</p>

<p>To assess the hypothesis that members of a specific group will interpret ambiguous words in a biased manner, we need to identify a suitable group to compare to the general population. In this study, the researchers decided to use rowers since they form a group with very specific language. Moreover, the researchers also had access to such groups, making data collection easier. Amateur rowers provide an ideal population to explore this issue because of the cluster of highly familiar words that have an additional meaning that is highly specific to this sporting activity. For example the word &ldquo;square&rdquo; and &ldquo;feather&rdquo; refer to positions of the oar, &ldquo;catch&rdquo; refers to the moment when the oar enters the water, and &ldquo;crab&rdquo; refers to an error in which the rowers fails to remove the oar from the water at the correct time. While the relative frequencies of these meanings will be close to zero outside of a rowing context, for keen rowers these meanings will be highly familiar and may even have become their preferred meaning.</p>
