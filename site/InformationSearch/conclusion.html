<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>In this study, crime scenario stimuli were used to discern whether people display the ‘diversity effect’. This is based upon people inferring structure in causal hierarchies, and as a consequence, considering a causally diverse piece of evidence to be preferable and more important than a causally proximate piece of evidence.  Furthermore, we were interested in whether this effect was modulated by the ‘diagnosticity’ of the information. Specifically, it was proposed that the diversity effect would no longer be present if the diverse piece of information was perceived to have diagnostic value.</p>

<p>Data was initially analysed using logistic regression, a Chi-square test, and a repeated measures ANOVA. All of these analysis methods concurred in their results. Specifically, the logistic regression demonstrated that the addition of the predictor variable ‘condition’, (that is whether the decisions about witness choice were made in the ‘same’ or ‘different’ condition) was able to significantly improve prediction of what witness would be chosen in both the time and location scenario. The Chi square test demonstrated that participants choice of witness was not independent from condition. Finally, the repeated measures ANOVA demonstrated an interaction between witness choice and condition.</p>

<p>Post hoc means comparisons tests including parametric independent samples t test and non-parametric Mann Whitney test were used to explore these findings further. These revealed there was evidence for both the diversity and diagnosticity effect. Participants chose to interview a witness from a diverse location or time point more often than a witness from the same location or time point when the diagnosticity of the information was the same. This demonstrates the diversity effect, as participants have made an inference from the structure in the causal hierarchy regarding the importance of the information. However, when the diagnosticity of the information was manipulated, making the ‘different’ condition less diagnostic (that is, the location or time was more distant, which may have had the effect of making the potential witness seem less reliable), participants gave the more diverse witness lower ratings compared to the proximal witness, and chose this proximal witness more often. This demonstrates that participants are sensitive to the diagnostic value of the information, and no longer prefer diverse information once it is seen as being less diagnostic. Thus the main hypotheses that participants infer structure in causal hierarchies and favour diverse evidence, but that this is modulated by the diagnosticity of the evidence were supported.</p>

<p>In the time scenario, there was a main effect of condition, whereby overall participants rated the witnesses as being more important in the ‘same’ condition in comparison to the different condition. However, this may be driven by the fact that participants valued all witnesses quite highly, apart from when the diagnosticity of the information was low. The repeated measures ANOVA also demonstrated an interaction between the witness ratings and gender. However, this study was very unbalanced in terms of gender, making it problematic to interpret the significance of this finding.   The experiment would need to be repeated with groups more representative of the general population in order to be able to make claims about the generalizability of results, or potential individual differences.  </p>

<p>There were 2 scenarios which had information about an accused person location and time after a crime was committed. Analysis of the first time scenario demonstrated that participants choices were no different than what we would expect where the participants choosing at random. As such, the stimuli were altered, whereby the disparity in diagnosticity of the information was increased in the ‘different’ condition. Additionally, participants were provided with diagrammatic aid to make this more equivalent to the location scenario. This raises an interesting question regarding how different 2 witnesses or pieces of information are required to be before one is devalued as it is perceived as being less diagnostic. There is also the possibility that people reason about different domains of information in different ways. For example, a person’s previous convictions may influence how likely we think they are to be guilty, but this might be different depending on the gravity and similarity of the offences. Are people more likely to think a person is guilty of theft if they have a previous conviction for drunk driving, or the more similar but less serious offence of shop lifting?</p>

<p>In conclusion, we have demonstrated both the diversity effect and diagnostic reasoning when participants reason about crime scenario. This paradigm could be generalised to explore other aspects of how people gather and assess information.</p>
