<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>There is much research into whether and how the functional 
architecture of visual cortex changes in the case of deprivation or 
atypical visual input (Hubel and Wiesel, 1977).  However, the impact of 
deprivation of one sense on the cortical architecture of remaining 
senses is less well understood. The study of visual changes in 
congenitally deaf people provides a model to address this question. 
Deaf people have specifically enhanced detection of targets (Loke and 
Song, 1991), and motion discrimination in the peripheral visual field 
(PVF) (Neville and Lawson, 1987).  These changes are thought to be 
compensatory, as deaf people rely on peripheral vision to orient to new 
information (Merabet and Pascual-Leone, 2010).</p>

<p>There are 3 possible explanations of why deaf people have better 
peripheral vision, all of which may contribute to the differences 
observed between these groups. The first explanation is based on 
‘crossmodal plasticity’. Crossmodal plasticity is when cortex of an 
interrupted sense is taken over by remaining senses. Specifically for 
deaf people, visual processing colonises auditory cortex, and its 
increased representation in these regions leads to behavioural 
advantage.  The second explanation is based upon attentional accounts, 
whereby deaf people’s brains do not differ from those of hearing 
people, but where they allocate their attention to does. The 
reallocation of attention to the peripheral visual field results in 
their improved performance in this region of the visual field. Finally, 
‘compensatory hypertrophy’ is the scenario in which the architecture of 
visual cortex itself changes to in some way improve accuracy in these 
visual skills. We will discuss evidence for each of these explanations 
in turn.</p>

<h2>Crossmodal Plasticity</h2>

<p>Using a neuroimaging technique to measure electrical activity 
generated by neural firing through the scalp (electroencephalogram 
(EEG)), deaf people demonstrated a greater amount of electrical 
activity from regions including auditory cortex in comparison to 
hearing people when detecting changes in dot motion in the PVF.</p>

<h2>Attention-based accounts</h2>
<p>Differences between deaf and hearing people’s vision have also 
been explained in terms of differences in the ‘gradient of visual 
attention’ from the centre of the visual field to the periphery 
(Proksch and Bavelier, 2002). Attentional load paradigms are used to 
measure the allocation of attention throughout different locations in 
the visual field (Lavie, 1995). This paradigm demonstrated deaf 
participants dedicated greater attentional resources to the peripheral 
visual field, at the cost of the central visual field (Proksch and 
Bavelier, 2002). The authors do not preclude changes at a neural level, 
but strongly argue differences in visuo-spatial attention are sufficient 
to explain differences between the groups.</p>

<h2>Compensatory hypertrophy</h2>

<p>Accounts based on compensatory hypertrophy of the visual system are 
not widely supported. Retinotopic mapping is a procedure using fMRI to 
define each visual area. Using this method, evidence of compensatory 
hypertrophy of the visual system was sought through measuring the 
surface area in each visual area and the absolute amount of neural 
activation in these areas (Fine et al., 2005). No differences were 
reported between deaf and hearing groups in these characteristics 
in early visual cortex (Fine et al., 2005). However, this study may 
have been underpowered: the surface area of early visual cortex can 
vary by a factor of 3 between individuals (Dougherty et al., 2003), 
and this massive amount variation between individuals therefore would 
be likely to obscure any differences between groups of 6 as used in 
this study. Furthermore, matching size and activation levels in visual 
areas does not rule out the possibility of changes in functional 
architecture of these regions. There are many other properties 
which may differ.</p>

<p>In summary, there is evidence that crossmodal plasticity and changes 
in attentional allocation in deaf people are able to contribute to the 
account for their improved peripheral vision. However, it is possible 
hypotheses based upon compensatory hypertrophy have not been explored 
appropriately. The explanation based on crossmodal plasticity and 
attentional differences provides no information on how visual 
information comes to be processed in auditory cortex. The visual system 
is hierarchical and has a high degree of structure. Thus we would 
anticipate that visual information in auditory cortex would be 
preceeded by changes in visual cortex.</p>

<p>Additionally, optical imaging techniques have revealed an increase 
in areas of the retina and optic nerve which process information in the 
peripheral visual field. These data strongly imply changes are present 
at the earliest stages of visual processing, and an account of 
increased sensitivity to the PVF in deaf people based on reallocation 
of attention and cross-modal responses is insufficient.</p>

<p>In this study we will use population receptive field modelling with 
fMRI in order to characterise visual cortex in deaf people. Population 
receptive field modelling is a way of defining each visual area and 
providing a statistical summary of the receptive field properties of 
neurons at each voxel (Dumoulin and Wandell, 2008). In this study we will 
model population receptive field size, where we fit a Gaussian curve at 
each voxel which corresponds to the amount of the visual field 
represented at this point.</p>
  
<p>We hypothesized there would be differences between deaf and hearing groups in early visual cortex in areas which represent the peripheral visual field. This would demonstrate evidence of compensatory hypertrophy. </p>
