<h1>Repeated-measures ANOVA in SPSS</h1>
<p>In the main menu, go to Analyze/General Linear Model/Repeated Measures</p>

<p>A dialog box will come up in which you need to specify the 
within-subjects factors comprising the repeated measures. 
In this case, there is one such factor, namely the location in the 
visual field (central, medium and peripheral. We have called this 
variable VF_location, and indicate it has three levels.</p>

<p>After clicking on "define", the model can be specified. We first
need to choose which variables correspond to the three levels of the 
VF_location variable. These are VA_CVF, VA_MVF, and VAR_PVF, 
respectively. There is one between-subjects factor, namely group 
(deaf, hearing). The corresponding variable in the dataset is 
group_psych and this is entered in the "Between-Subjects Factor(s)" 
box.</p>

<p>Before running the analysis we can ask for post-hoc tests and other 
additional output by clicking on the "Options..." button.</p>
