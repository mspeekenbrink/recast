<h1>Results</h1>

<p>The variables of interest in this study are population receptive 
field size (pRF), visual acuity and cortical thickness. The population 
receptive field size is the amount of visual space a population of 
neurons is capable of representing. The population here refers to the 
neurons in a particular voxel of the scan. To model this, we iteratively 
fit a Gaussian curve at each voxel, and the size of this Gaussian curve 
corresponds to the pRF size.</p>

<p>Visual acuity is the acuteness (or clearness) of vision. This is 
dependent upon factors relating to the eye. All participants had their 
vision corrected to normal throughout the course of this experiment 
either via glasses or contact lenses, and so any remaining variation in 
this measurement has been posited to be constrained by the functional 
architecture of primary visual cortex (Duncan and Boynton, 2003).</p>

<p>Cortical thickness corresponds to the thickness of the cortical 
sheet, that is, grey matter. These measurements are generated during 
the automated cortical reconstruction process in FreeSurfer, and are 
calculated as the distance between the white matter and pial 
surface.</p>

<p>Each of these measures are considered across visual eccentricity, 
which is a measurement of distance from fixation along the horizontal 
horopter, expressed in degrees of visual angle.</p>

<p>Plotting the relevant data can be a useful first stage in analysis, 
and will help you identify whether there are any issues with the data. 
These have been generated for you.<br />

<h2>Psychophysics Data</h2>

<p>Initially we first wanted to determine whether the finding of deaf 
people having enhanced visual acuity in the periphery could be 
replicated. This was tested with a repeated measures ANOVA with 1 
visual field location central, middle and peripheral) as a within-subjects 
factor, and group (deaf or hearing) as a between-subjects factor. A 
repeated measures analysis is appropriate in this instance as each 
participant was tested at multiple locations in their visual field.</p>

<p>Before performing a repeated-measures ANOVA, we should check whether 
the underlying <a class="assumptions" 
href="../assumptions/RMAnova.html" title="Repeated measures 
ANOVA">assumptions</a> of the analysis are satisfied.<br />
<a class="btn SPSSinstructions" href="SPSS/normality.html">SPSS: 
Shapiro-Wilk</a>
</p>

<p>The Shapiro-Wilk test can be used to test for normality. The results 
from this test show that the distribution of the measurements for 
visual acuity in the middle and peripheral visual field do not 
significantly deviate from a normal distribution (W(28)=0.979, p=0.825, 
W=0.931, p=0.065, respectively), and so satisfy the normality 
assumption. However, this is not the case for the visual acuity 
measurement in the central visual field (W(28)=0.862, p=0.002). 
Repeated measures ANOVAs tend to be robust against violations of the 
Normality assumption. Nevertheless, this is important to bear in mind 
when considering results, particularly those pertaining to the central 
visual field.</p>

<p>
<a class="btn SPSSinstructions" href="SPSS/RM_ANOVA2.html">SPSS: 
Repeated-measures ANOVA</a></br>
Mauchley’s test of sphericity is significant, demonstrating the 
assumption of sphericity is violated (W(2)=0.205, p<0.001). Thus, a 
correction on the degrees of freedom, such as the Greenhouse-Geisser 
correction, should be used.</p>

<p>The results of the repeated-measures ANOVA show there are significant main effects of visual field location (F(1.114)=149.397, p<0.001), and group (F(1)=4.642, p=0.041). Additionally, there is a significant interaction between visual field location and group (F(1.114)=7.198, p=0.010).</p>

<h3>Post-hoc Analysis</h3>

<p>
In order to determine where in the visual field the effects lie, we 
completed a post-hoc analysis, which consisted of independent samples 
t-tests. 
<a class="btn SPSSinstructions" href="SPSS/Independent_T_3.html">SPSS: 
Independent samples t-test</a>
</p>

<p>There were no significant differences between the deaf and hearing groups in the central or middle visual field. However, there was a significant difference between deaf and hearing groups in the PVF (t(26)=2.549, p=0.017). This replicates previous findings that deaf people have enhanced resolution in the peripheral visual field, and is an important first step if we want to examine the neural differences between deaf and hearing people's vision.</p>


<p>As the visual acuity measurements in the central visual field 
differed significantly from the normal distribution, a Mann Whitely U 
test (non-parametric alternative to an independent samples t-test) can 
be used to check the robustness of the results of the t-test.<br />
<a class="btn SPSSinstructions" href="SPSS/NP_means_3.html">SPSS: 
Mann-Whitney test</a>
</p>
<p>The result of this test confirms the previous finding that there is no significant difference between the deaf and hearing groups in their acuity in the central visual field (U=87.0, p=0.650).</p>

<h2>Visual Mapping Data</h2>
<p>The pRF measurements reflect the width of a Gaussian curve fitted at 
each visual eccentricity. The Gaussian curve represents a neural 
tuning curve, the main idea being that while each neuron has a 
preferred level of visual eccentricity, they will also respond to 
other eccentricity levels, with a gradually diminishing response the 
further the eccentricity is from the preferred level of eccentricity. 
The higher the width of the tuning curve, the more information a 
neuron responds to. The pRF measures thus reflect how much of the visual 
world is represented at that point in visual cortex. 
In this experiment we wanted to know whether these differed between deaf 
and hearing participants, and if they were different, at which location 
in the visual field.</p>

<p>There are multiple ways in which we can examine this hypothesis. 
Performing an independent samples t-test at every eccentricity to see 
where the groups differ is not an option for a number of reasons. As 
there are several measurements generated for each participant, there is 
correlation in the errors which violates assumptions of typical between 
subjects tests. Additionally, when performing a number of statistical 
comparisons on a data set, by chance, 5% of these will give you false 
positives. Therefore it is essential to perform a multiple comparisons 
correction. A popular example of this is the Bonferroni correction, in 
which you divide the threshold for statistical significance (&alpha;) 
by the number of statistical tests you are performing to determine a 
new threshold for statistical significance. Formally for this example, 
if we set &alpha;=0.05, and the number of tests is 28, the new threshold 
for statistical significance would be 0.0018 (0.05/28=0.0018). Thus any 
effect would need to be massive in order to be detected.</p> 
<p>Alternatively,
a repeated-measures ANOVA could be used. A problem here is that there 
were a number of missing values in the data. For certain participants 
and eccentricity levels, the data was too noisy to allow accurate 
estimation of visual field size.  
In a repeated-measures ANOVA, if some of the values are missing for a 
subject, all the data from that subject is excluded from the analysis. 
In the present dataset, this means that the data from 7 participants 
would be excluded from the analysis, which reduced the power of the 
repeated-measures ANOVA considerably.</p>

<p>For these reasons, we chose to analyse the data with a linear 
mixed-effects analysis. A linear mixed-effects model allows you to 
replicate a repeated-measures ANOVA. However, it is a more general 
model and deals with missing values "gracefully" (i.e., you don't have 
to ignore all the observations from a participant if one of the values 
is missing). </p>

<h3>Linear mixed-effects model</h3>

<p>For the purposes of this experiment, hemispheres are the unit of 
measurement. There is a complete map of the visual field in primary 
visual cortex in each hemisphere, and these visual maps in the 2 
hemispheres in a participants' brain differ, and as such, considering 
each hemisphere separately rather than the average of these is 
considered a more accurate and statistically sensitive approach. 
pRF size is the dependent variable. We'll assume a linear relation 
between eccentricity and pRF, but allow the slope (steepness) of this 
relation to vary between the groups. We can do this by including an 
interaction between eccentricity and group. From the main hypothesis, 
we would expect little difference between the groups for low values of 
eccentricity, but the difference to increase at higher values of 
eccentricity. As such, we expect the slope to be higher for the deaf 
group than for the hearing group. In a model with an interaction between 
group and eccentricity, one should be careful with interpreting a main 
effect of group. As the difference between the groups varies with 
eccentricity, it matters where you look for a difference. The main 
effect of group is estimated at the point where all the other 
independent variables in the model are 0. Using the original 
eccentricity variable, we would thus test for a difference between the 
groups at the centre of the visual field. As we don't expect a 
difference here, this test would have little value. A more meaningful 
test can be obtained by changing the point of comparison, by rescaling 
the eccentricity variable. For instance, by centering eccentricity 
(subtracting the mean), we can test for a group difference at a 
medium eccentricity. If we want to test for a group difference at the 
highest eccentricity, we can subtract 30 instead of the mean.</p>

<p>By including random effects, we can allow for individual differences. 
For instance, by including a random intercept, we can allow for 
individual differences in average pRF value. We can allow for individual 
differences in the steepness of the relation between eccentricity and 
pRF by including a random slope for eccentricity. Interpretation of 
these effects is again dependent on the scale of the eccentricity 
variable. As the intercept is the value of pRF at the point where the 
eccentricity variable is 0. Without a random slope, the differences 
between individuals (within a group) would be the same at each 
eccentricity value. However, if the slope varies between individuals, 
individual differences may be larger or smaller, depending on the value 
of eccentricity. This is for similar reasons as before (we can think of 
hemispheres moderating the effect of eccentricity). So whether we find 
significant variation in the intercept may again depend on whether we 
center (or otherwise transform) eccentricity.</p>
 
<p>For our analysis, we chose to centre eccentricity. In the model, we 
include fixed effects for eccentricity, group, and their interaction, 
and a random effect of eccentricity as well as a random intercept. 
Finally, we allow the random slopes and intercepts to be correlated 
over individuals by choosing an unstructured covariance matrix.</p>

<p>The analysis demonstrates there is a highly significant effect of 
eccentricity (F(1417)=1951, p&lt;.001), and in addition a significant 
interaction between group and eccentricity (F(1417)=9.380, p=0.002).</p>

<<transformVariable_10>>


<h2>Thickness Data</h2>

<p>Thickness data is a measure of cortical thickness (grey matter) at each eccentricity. In primary visual cortex, thickness typically varies between 1.5mm and 2.5mm (though in the rest of the brain this is between 1.5-4.5mm). These values can be plotted to check they fall within these limits.</p> 
<<thicknessVsEcc>>

<p>As for the pRF sizes, it is not a statistically sound or sensitive 
approach to test this hypothesis with independent samples t tests, 
although these can be used for post-hoc analysis.  Analogous to the pRF 
size data, the repeated measures ANOVA is likely to be underpowered 
because of missing data points. We will therefore use another linear 
mixed-effects model.

<h3>Linear mixed-effects model</h3>

<p>The mixed effect model can be completed using the instructions above 
as a template. The analysis demonstrates there is a significant effect 
of effect of eccentricity (F(1781)=79.76, p&lt;.001), and a significant 
interaction between group and eccentricity (F(1781)=13.16, 
p&lt;.001).</p>

<h2>Relationships between Behavioural, Structural and Functional Imaging Data</h2>

<p>The premise of this study is that visual skills are in some way 
linked to neural architecture, thus it is important to test whether 
there is a relationship between behavioural measurements of visual 
acuity and the neural measurements of pRF size and cortical thickness. 
The measures for central visual field correspond to 2&deg;, the middle 
visual field at 10&deg; and the peripheral visual field at 20&deg;.

<h3>Pearson Product Moment Correlation</h3>

<p>This can be used to test whether there is a linear relationship between the behavioural measurements of visual acuity and the neural measurements of pRF size and cortical thickness.</p>

Assumptions
Linear relationship between variables 
There are no outliers
Variables are continuous
Variables are normally distributed 

<p>The validity of most of these assumptions can be visually assessed 
in a scatterplot. For this study, correlations have to be computed at the central, middle and peripheral locations in the visual field separately. We already know that visual acuity decreases as you move into the periphery, and that pRF size increases as you go into the periphery. Analysing all positions in the visual field together will reflect these relationships. However, if we want to be able to address the question of whether individuals' measures of pRF size or thickness can be correlated with either each other, or participants' visual acuity, we need to look at each area of the visual field individually.</p>
<<correlation_11>>  

<p>As 9 statistical tests were performed, to control the family-wise 
error rate, we should apply a correction for multiple comparisons to 
the significance level. A Bonferroni correction (Bonferroni) is the 
simplest, which would reduce the significance level for each individual 
test to &alpha;=0.006 (0.05/9). There is a significant negative 
correlation between visual acuity and thickness in the middle visual 
field (r=-0.526, p=0.004). However, none of the other correlational 
tests were significant.</p>
<p>When the relationship between the variables is not linear, there are 
non-parametric options for testing the correlation between variables, 
including Kendall’s tau and Spearman’s rho. These measure how when one 
variable increases, the other variable increases (or decreases).</p>
<p>Correlations are sensitive to the range over which data is sampled, 
when there is a wider range it becomes a lot easier to detect effects in 
comparison to when they are compressed over a smaller range. The range 
of visual acuity is small, thus making it harder to detect an effect. 
Note this is not the same as the scale of values, and therefore a linear 
transformation of the values to make them larger will not remedy this 
issue.</p>
<p>Typically, at least 30 pairs of observations are required in order 
to obtain a reliable test for a correlation.  Thus this study may have 
been underpowered in this instance. Additionally, it is plausible that 
different neurobiological mechanisms are underpinning the enhanced 
acuity in either group, and therefore considering them together in the 
one correlational analysis may obscure  weak effects.</p>
