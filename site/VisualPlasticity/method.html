<h1>Method</h1>

<h2>Participants</h2>

<p>We collected data from 15 congenitally profoundly/severely deaf 
participants and 15 hearing participants. One deaf participant was 
excluded from the MRI analysis due to excessive motion in the scanner.  
Psychophysics data was used from this participant. Psychophysics data 
was not collected from 1 male deaf participant as a result of time 
restrictions at the experimental sessions. Typically, severely or 
profoundly deaf people will typically learn some sign language at some 
stage in their life from their deaf peers, even when they use spoken 
language as their primary form of communication. As we were interested 
in isolating the effect of auditory deprivation on the visual processing 
stream, we were keen to minimise any impact of the use of a visual 
language. Thus deaf participants were contrasted with hearing 
participants who also knew sign language (the majority of whom were sign 
language interpreters or teachers of the deaf). As the brain is most 
plastic in infants, we imposed the additional criteria that participants 
had to have begun to learn sign language after the age of 10 years, in 
order to limit this effect of early exposure. Participants were right 
handed and screened for additional neurological and psychiatric 
concerns. During testing, all participants' vision was corrected to 
normal. Table 1 displays the participants' characteristics. Research 
was approved by UCL Ethics Committee.</p>

<h2>Psychophysics Task</h2>

<p>We tested participants' visual acuity in the central, middle and 
peripheral visual field using a computer based task. Two pairs of 
co-linear dots appeared on either side of a fixation cross, and the 
participants were required to indicate via a button press which pair of 
dots were misaligned. A staircase procedure was used to estimate 
participants' acuity: if the participants performed well, the task was 
made more difficult by reducing the misalignment of the dots, whereas if 
they performed poorly, the task was made easier by increasing the 
misalignment. Depending on the task condition, the dots appeared in the 
central, middle or peripheral visual field, and participants completed 
each of these tasks in a random order.</p>

<h2>fMRI Stimuli and Task</h2>

<p>
We collected data at the Birkbeck UCL Centre for Neuroimaging. 
Participants had a structural brain scan taken. They then underwent 
three runs of functional MRI scanning. Specifically, a retinotopic 
mapping procedure was carried out which enables the functional 
delineation of different visual areas in the brain. For the 
purposes of this study we were interested in primary visual cortex 
(V1). Figure 1 gives an example of this stimuli. The high contrast 
black and white checkerboard patterns in these stimuli are used as 
they drive strong responses from visual cortex. The rotating ring and 
wedge mean all areas of the visual field will be covered in order to 
enable mapping. For the final functional run, participants viewed a 
full screen checkerboard for 2 seconds, followed by 29 seconds of a 
grey screen. This was in order to model the haemodynamic response 
(blood flow) through visual cortex, which improved model fitting. 
Figures  1 and 2 provide examples of these stimuli.</p>

<p>For each of these runs participants were required to monitor the 
colour of the fixation dot, and count how many times this changed from 
blue to red. This task was designed to ensure the participants 
maintained fixation, but was easy enough that all participants would be 
able to complete it, without it introducing group differences.</p>


<h2>MRI Data Analysis</h2>
<p>The structural data was analysed using FreeSurfer. This generates a 
cortical reconstruction in which white and grey matter are segmented. 
From this, cortical thickness can be calculated. Additionally the 
functional data is aligned with these cortical reconstructions for 
further analysis.</p>

<p>The functional MRI data was analysed in SPM8 and custom in-house 
built software.  Following delineating primary visual cortex, we were 
able to generate a population receptive field size (pRF) at each visual 
eccentricity.</p>
